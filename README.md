# [Catch the Robber](http://meta.codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/5480/38214)

This is a King-of-the-hill challenge I made.

Unfortunately, I won't post the challenge as

 - I don't know how to implement the concept for Traps, PressureSensors and TrapDetector5000s (without letting the user cheat by using methods they aren't supposed to use).
 - I don't have time as school has started and I'll be much less active.
 
I've written some code which works, but doesn't have the concept of Traps, PressureSensors and TrapDetector5000s.

**How to Run**

Download all files (except "_Main (not working).java_") and compile them all. Run `Play.class` after compiling all the files.

**Example**

The challenge comes with a working example of a cop(_RandCop.java_) and a robber(_RandRobber.java_). Both of then moves randomly.

**What is the `(not working)` file for?**

The file "_Main (not working).java_" is my failed attempt at implementing Traps. I know why it doesn't work, but I don't know how to correct it.
